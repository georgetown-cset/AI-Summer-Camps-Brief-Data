# AI-Summer-Camps-Brief-Data

This repo contains the AI Summer Camps catalog that was used in the "U.S. AI Summer Camps: Opportunities and Gaps for Youth" CSET Data Brief. Note that the list of camps collected were a snapshot of what was available at the time and that additional camps could have been made publically available since the brief was written.
